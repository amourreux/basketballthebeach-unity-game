## Basketball: The Beach - Privacy policy

Welcome to Basketball: The Beach game for Android!

This is a free Android game developed by Mehmet Emre Portakal using unity. the game is also available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emreportakal.com.basketball.thebeach).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Mehmet Emre Portakal
